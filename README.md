# FizzBuzz - Swift

## Welcome

This repo is an example of how to develop a tested FizzBuzz application using Swift.

## Instructions

The simplest way to see the app in action is as follows:
1. git clone https://github.com/ocripps24/fizzbuzz-swift
2. cd FizzBuzzs
3. xed . (to launch XCode)
4. cmd + r (to run the app)
5. The app will launch in the simulator

## Process

I have used a TDD process to construct the app, whilst following along to a tutorial from Yvette, a Maker's alum.

## Yvette's Extension Ideas

* Stop the game when the user makes a mistake
* Change to UI when the user loses
* Add a timer (using a CocoaPod)
* Store the playerâ€™s high score
* Be able to change the Fizz and Buzz numbers

## Additional Extension Ideas

* Add app icon
* Create fresh UI
* Add achievements
